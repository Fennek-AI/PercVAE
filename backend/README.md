# Fennek AI Backend Service
A simple webservice using FastAPI.

Just start it with:
```
python main.py
```

You may need to adapt the parameters for the model being used, which are hardcoded as of now. This will change and be done via a configuration file in the future. The plan is to use the Google gin framework for flexible configuration.
