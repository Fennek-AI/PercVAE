# Fennek Backend Service
A simple webservice using FastAPI.

Just start it with:
```
python app.py
```


You may need to adapt the parameters for the model being used, which are hardcoded as of now. This will change and be done via a configuration file in the future.
We should have a look at this google/gin framework for the config stuff anyway.
