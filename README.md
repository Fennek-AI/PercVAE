# Sound Designer 
Web UI for generating sounds using ReactJS and react-bootstrap.

### Usage
Run npm install, run pip install, start the flask server.
ATTENTION: You need to (as of now) manually copy the react build from the build directory into the directory
service/static (yes, there will be another dir in there called "static" as well)
